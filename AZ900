1) Cloud Computing 
computing services over the internet, VMs, storage, DBs, networking, IoT, ML/AI
helps in rapid expansion of IT footprint.

2) Shared responsibility model
traditional Datacenter --> comapny maintains everything
shared responsibility model --> responsibility shared between cloud provider and consumer. Cloud provider --> datacenter security, power, cooling, 
network connectivity (basically everything related to datacenter). Consumer --> data and info stored in the cloud and its access security.
Sometimes the responsibility also depends on the situation. ex a) cloud SQL DB --> maintenance responsibility --> cloud provider
b) VM --> SQL DB --> maintenance responsibility --> consumer
The responsibility also depends on the service type ex: IaaS (Only physical hosts/networkdatacenter responsibility with cloud provider),
PaaS (IaaS responsibilities + OS, applications, identity and directory infra related responsibilities given to cloud provider),
SaaS (Info, data, devices, accounts/identities are only left with consumer)

3) Cloud models
a) Private cloud : used by single entity, much greater control but also great cost, can be even provided by a third party.
b) public cloud : controlled,maintained by third party. 
c) Hybrid cloud : both public and private cloud in an interconnected environment. ex: using public cloud when there is a temporary surge in demand.
d) Multi cloud : using multiple public cloud providers.

Azure Arc --> technologies to manage cloud environment (whether public cloud or private or hybrid or multi)
Azure VMware solutions --> run VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.

4) Consumption based model

IT infra models, 2 types of expenses --> CapEx, OpEx
CapEx --> one time, upfront, tangible resources
OpEx --> overtime ex: cloud computing

Cloud computing --> OpEx, consumption based model, no upfront cost, pay for more resources only when it's needed,stop paying as soon as they are not required,
don't have to worry about correct/accurate estimation of the resources needed. Just add/remove resources as and when required.

5) Cloud pricing model
pay-as-you-go pricing model --> pay only for what you use (basically rent compute power/storage)
Adv : operating cost management/planning, more efficient infra, dynamic scaling as per need
